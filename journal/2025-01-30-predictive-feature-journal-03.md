#### 2025-01-30 13:51 UTC+7 - UI Implementation Issues in Predictive Analysis

- **Action**: Identified UI inconsistencies in PettyTheftPrediction component
- **Details**:
  1. Current UI Issues:
     - Crime type selection not following design guidelines:
       * Missing categorization into misdemeanors and felonies
       * Not using proper shadcn/ui Select component
       * Lacks glass-morphism effects specified in about.md
     - Question flow interface needs improvement:
       * No progress indicators during questioning
       * Missing real-time updates for match scores
       * Not following responsive grid-based design
     - Results display needs enhancement:
       * Card layout not utilizing glass-morphism
       * Score breakdown visualization could be improved
       * Profile details section needs better organization

  2. Required Changes:
     - Implement proper crime type categorization:
       * Group crimes into misdemeanors (Petty Theft, Vandalism) and felonies (Burglary, Murder, etc.)
       * Use shadcn/ui Select with optgroup for categories
       * Add glass-morphism effect using proper CSS classes
     - Enhance question flow:
       * Add progress bar to show question completion
       * Implement real-time score updates
       * Use grid layout for better responsiveness
     - Improve results visualization:
       * Apply glass-morphism to result cards
       * Use shadcn/ui Progress for score visualization
       * Organize profile details in collapsible sections

  3. Technical Considerations:
     - Need to use shadcn/ui components consistently:
       * Select for dropdowns
       * Progress for indicators
       * Card with proper styling
     - Add glass-morphism classes:
       * backdrop-filter: blur
       * background opacity
       * border effects
     - Implement grid system:
       * Use Tailwind's grid classes
       * Consider mobile breakpoints
       * Maintain proper spacing

- **Next Steps**:
  1. Update crime type selection UI
  2. Implement progress indicators
  3. Enhance results visualization
  4. Add glass-morphism effects
  5. Test responsive behavior

- **Technical Notes**:
  - Reference shadcn/ui documentation for component usage
  - Use Tailwind's built-in glass-morphism utilities
  - Consider adding custom CSS for specific effects
  - Ensure TypeScript types are properly maintained

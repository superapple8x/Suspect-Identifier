#### 2025-01-30 08:34 UTC+7 - Implemented Predictive Analysis Feature for Petty Theft

- **Action**: Added predictive analysis capability for petty theft cases
- **Details**:
  1. Created new PredictiveParameters interface with:
     - Temporal patterns (time of day, day of week, seasonal variations)
     - Environmental factors (location weights, weather conditions, crowd density)
     - Behavioral markers (escalation, consistency, recidivism)

  2. Updated PettyTheftProfile to include predictive parameters:
     - Added full predictive parameter structure
     - Enhanced existing profiles with predictive data
     - Maintained backward compatibility with existing scoring system

  3. Implemented PredictiveScorer class with:
     - Bayesian scoring engine based on empirical weights
     - Confidence calculation system
     - Detailed score breakdown for transparency
     - Meta-analysis based weighting system:
       * Prior petty offenses (0.28 ±0.03)
       * Temporal patterns (0.22 ±0.04)
       * Location type (0.19 ±0.05)
       * Distraction methods (0.15 ±0.06)
       * Environmental factors (0.10 ±0.08)
       * Demographic markers (0.06 ±0.12)

  4. Created PettyTheftPrediction component:
     - Real-time prediction calculation
     - Visual score representation
     - Confidence level indicators
     - Detailed breakdown of contributing factors
     - Key indicators display

  5. Modified SuspectScorer to handle petty theft specifics:
     - Updated weapon scoring to consider concealment methods
     - Enhanced location type matching
     - Improved motive analysis

  6. Integrated with main application:
     - Added new predictive analysis option to search methods
     - Created dedicated route for predictions
     - Enhanced UI with modern visualization

- **Technical Notes**:
  - Used TypeScript for type safety
  - Implemented proper error handling
  - Added confidence intervals for predictions
  - Used shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
  - Maintained responsive design

- **Next Steps**:
  1. Gather user feedback on prediction accuracy
  2. Implement monthly model recalibration
  3. Add more sophisticated pattern recognition
  4. Expand to other crime types
  5. Add historical case validation
